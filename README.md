Android multi language dictionary/thesaurus app

The app currently translates german words into romanian, english and french. 
Furthermore it looks for similar german words, antonyms and declension.

The words are grouped in lessons, which can be named as pleased.

A search function looks into all entered and found entries.

The internal database can be backed up as external file and can be, if necessary, restored from it.
